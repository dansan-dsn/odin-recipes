    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A Flat round cornmeal cake popular in central and South America,
      particulary Colombia and Venezuela.
    </p>
    <p>It resembles muffins and is made of various toppings and fillings.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 ½ cups lukewarm water</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal</li>
      <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; gradually stir in
        cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, moist,
        malleable dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; pat each ball to flatten
        into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in batches
        until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked
        arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to
        handle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated knife
        to form a pita-like pocket.
      </li>
    </ol>
