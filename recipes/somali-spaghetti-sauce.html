    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This Somali-style spaghetti sauce recipe has my own little tweak to it. We
      make this once a week. I hope you enjoy this!

      <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Himalayan pink salt</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt-free seasoning blend</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1 onion, diced</li>
      <li>2 carrots, diced</li>
      <li>1 large potato, peeled and cubed</li>
      <li>2 (14 ounce) cans diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons water, or to taste (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package angel hair pasta</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place cilantro and garlic in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until
        finely chopped.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toast cumin seeds in a small pot over low heat until fragrant, 2 to 3
        minutes. Cool, 5 minutes. Grind into a powder using a spice grinder or a
        mortal and pestle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer ground cumin to a small bowl. Add Himalayan pink salt,
        turmeric, paprika, Italian seasoning, seasoning blend, and black pepper;
        set spice mixture aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add ground beef; cook and stir
        until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1/2 spice mixture. Add onion;
        cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Add carrots and potato;
        cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, about 5
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in tomatoes; bring sauce to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; stir
        in cilantro-garlic mixture and remaining 1/2 spice mixture. Simmer,
        stirring occasionally, until flavors combine, 30 to 40 minutes. Thin
        sauce with water if it seems too thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair
        pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm
        to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain. Serve sauce over pasta.
      </li>
    </ol>
